# SQL-analysis-E-commerce
## This project performs an analysis of the Olist Brazilian E-commerce dataset using SQL and Python to drive business intelligence. By evaluating key metrics such as Gross Merchandise Value (GMV),RFM and Average Order Value (AOV). Conclusion & Strategic Recommendations: The analysis reveals that 80% of platform revenue is concentrated in the top 20% of categories (e.g., Health & Beauty, Bed & Bath), yet growth is hindered by significant logistics friction, with delivery delays (Atraso) identified as the primary driver of negative 1-2 star reviews. To enhance Customer Satisfaction and GMV, the company should implement Single-Seller Cross-selling Bundles that pair high-traffic "anchor" products with high-margin accessories, ensuring synchronized shipping. Additionally, optimizing regional fulfillment in high-density hubs is essential to reduce Order Delay Rates and improve overall operational efficiency.
## The dataset is the Public Dataset by Olist, which can be downloaded from Kaggle.
